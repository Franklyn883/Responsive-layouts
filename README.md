# Day 1: Percentage vs Fixed Units

Welcome to Day 1 of the Kelvin Powell CSS Challenge on responsive design! Today's lesson is all about understanding the differences between percentage and fixed units in CSS and how to use them to create responsive designs.

## Overview

HTML is inherently responsive, but using fixed units like pixels (`px`) can make your design unresponsive on different screen sizes. To create responsive designs, we need to use percentage-based units for child elements. By setting the width of a child element as a percentage of the size of the parent element, we can ensure that the child element adjusts its size based on the parent's size.

If you want to make your website responsive, it's best to avoid setting fixed heights on elements. Instead, use padding to create space and make elements bigger. When the height is fixed, content may overflow the container when the screen size is smaller.

## Today's Exercise

 1. Limit the total width of the .intro-content to about half of it's parent
 2. Stop the text from overflowing out the bottom at small screen widths
    You may modify the HTML if needed
