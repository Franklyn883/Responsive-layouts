## DAY 3: MAX-WIDTH

Setting your width in percentage is great and allows for responsiveness, but when it comes to big screens, this can be terrible since it stretches across the entire screen. To fix this, we use max-width. For example, if we set the max-width of a container to 700px, our content can grow and shrink when the width size is below 700px, and once it exceeds it, it stops growing.

Using max-width instead of width in pixels or percentage allows for more flexibility in the design and accommodates a wide range of screen sizes. The challenge was great.
