## Day 8: Flexbox

Flexbox is a powerful CSS layout module that provides a flexible way to create responsive and dynamic layouts. When using `display: flex` on a container, the individual children will naturally shrink or grow to the size of their content. However, if you want all the children to have the same width, even those with less content, you can apply a width of `100%` to each child.
