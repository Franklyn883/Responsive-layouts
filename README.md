# Day 11/12: Flexbox Challenge - Navigation Bar

For the next two days, we will focus on creating a navigation bar using flexbox. The navigation bar is a common element in websites and requires proper layout and spacing of its items. Let's dive into the challenge!

## Challenge Description

1. Create a container element for the navigation bar and apply `display: flex` to it.
2. Inside the container, create multiple navigation items (e.g., links, buttons) as flex items.
3. Use flexbox properties to achieve the following:

   - Align the navigation items horizontally in a row.
   - Distribute the navigation items evenly along the main axis.
   - Apply appropriate spacing between the navigation items.
   - Ensure that the navigation items are vertically aligned.
