# 21-Day Kelvin Powell CSS Challenge - Responsive Design

Welcome to the **21-Day Kelvin Powell CSS Challenge** on responsive design! In this challenge, you will learn how to create responsive websites and web applications using CSS.

## Overview

This challenge is designed to help you improve your CSS skills and learn how to create responsive designs for different screen sizes and devices. Each day of the challenge will focus on a different aspect of responsive design, and you will be provided with resources and examples to help you learn and practice.

## My Participation

I am participating in this challenge and will be using a separate branch for each day of the challenge. The name of each branch will be the corresponding day of the challenge. For example, the branch for day 1 will be called `day1`, the branch for day 2 will be called `day2`, and so on.

By using separate branches, I can keep my work for each day of the challenge organized and easily track my progress throughout the challenge.

I'm excited to start this challenge and improve my CSS skills!
